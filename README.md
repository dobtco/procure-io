Procure.io Community Version [![](https://codeclimate.com/github/dobtco/procure-io.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dobtco/procure-io)
--------

Procurement software for the 21st century.

<em><strong>What's this "Community Version"?</strong> Nearly identical to our SaaS product, just with some of the multi-tenancy code taken out.</em> Try the **[demo](http://community-demo.procure.io/)**.

#### Setting up your development environment
- `git clone` the repo
- `bundle install`
- copy `config/database.yml.example` to `config/database.yml` and configure it as needed
- `rake db:setup`
- `rake db:seed:example`
- `rake rails:update:bin`
- `rails server` or run with your choice of server (we like [pow](http://pow.cx/))
- `rake jobs:work` to run delayed_job worker

> You'll all set to develop Procure.io. Login with `user1@example.com` and `password`.

#### Deploying to Heroku

Since this is a Rails 4 app, it requires some extra steps the first time you deploy it.

- `heroku create YOUR_APP_NAME`
- `heroku labs:enable user-env-compile`
- `heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql`
- Setup (or disable) the mailer in production.rb
- Add the environment variables specified in `.powenv.example`
- Add an additional environment variable with the database URL
  - `heroku config` to see the existing database URL
  - `heroku config:set DATABASE_URL="YOURDATABASEURLHERE"`
- `git push heroku master`
- `heroku run rake db:migrate`
- Launch a console `heroku run rails console` and:
- Create an organization: `Organization.create(name: "Oakland", email: "example@oakland.com", username: "oakland")`
- Create a user: `User.create(email: "adam@dobt.co", name: "Adam Becker", password: "password")`
- Assign that user to the organization's owners team:  `Organization.first.owners_team << User.first`

##### A couple notes:
- Procure.io uses delayed_job to run tasks asynchronously. Running a worker dyno costs $34.50/month, so if you want to avoid this charge, you'll have to disable the worker in the `Procfile`, and configure delayed_job with `Delayed::Worker.delay_jobs = false`.

- Procure.io is configured to use AWS for storing file uploads. You'll need to set environment variables for this too (specified in `/.powenv.example`), or change your application configuration to use another storage provider. Note that you can't use `:file` storage on Heroku, as the filesystem is not permanently writable.

#### Contributing

Procure.io is very early-stage alpha software, but if you're interested in getting your hands dirty, contributions are more than welcome. Your workflow should look something like this:

1. Fork the repo
2. Write some sweet code in a feature-branch
3. Write some tests (unit & acceptance, currently) that cover the functionality you added
4. Create a pull request
