#### Setting up your development environment
- `git clone` the repo
- `bundle install`
- copy `config/database.yml.example` to `config/database.yml` and configure it as needed
- `rake db:setup`
- `rake db:seed:example`
- `rails server` or run with your choice of server (we like [pow](http://pow.cx/))

> You'll all set to develop Procure.io. Login as an officer with `officer1@example.gov/password`, or as a vendor with `vendor1@example.com/password`.

#### Deploying to Heroku

Since this is a Rails 4 app, it requires some extra steps the first time you deploy it.

- `heroku create YOUR_APP_NAME`
- `heroku labs:enable user-env-compile`
- `heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql`
- Add an additional environment variable with the database URL
  - `heroku config` to see the existing database URL
  - `heroku config:set DATABASE_URL="YOURDATABASEURLHERE"`
- `git push heroku master`
- `heroku run rake db:migrate`
- `heroku run rake db:seed`
- Create your first officer with admin permissions: `heroku run rake 'create_admin[email@example.com,password]'`

##### A couple notes:
- Procure.io uses delayed_job to run tasks asynchronously. Running a worker dyno costs $34.50/month, so if you want to avoid this charge, you'll have to disable the worker in the `Procfile`, and configure delayed_job with `Delayed::Worker.delay_jobs = false`.

- Procure.io is configured to use AWS for storing file uploads. You'll need to set environment variables for this too (specified in `/.powenv.example`), or change your application configuration to use another storage provider. Note that you can't use `:file` storage on Heroku, as the filesystem is not permanently writable.

#### Contributing

Procure.io is very early-stage alpha software, but if you're interested in getting your hands dirty, contributions are more than welcome. Your workflow should look something like this:

1. Fork the repo
2. Write some sweet code
3. Write some tests (unit & acceptance, currently) that cover the functionality you added
4. Create a pull request
